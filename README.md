## Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir mini-edr && cd mini-edr

# Copy all the scripts from the artifact above into respective files

# Install dependencies
pip install psutil watchdog flask

# Or run the installer
python install.py
```

### 2. Configuration
Edit `config/settings.py` to customize:
- Email alerts (optional)
- Monitoring paths
- Detection sensitivity

### 3. Start EDR Service
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start main EDR service
python main.py

# Terminal 2: Start web dashboard  
cd dashboard && python app.py
```

### 4. Access Dashboard
Open browser: `http://localhost:5000`

## üîß Testing the EDR

### Test File Monitor
```bash
# Create suspicious file in temp directory
echo "test malware" > /tmp/malware.exe  # Linux
echo "test malware" > C:\Windows\Temp\malware.exe  # Windows
```

### Test Process Monitor
```bash
# Start suspicious process
nc -l 4444                    # Linux/Mac
powershell -enc "test"        # Windows
```

### Test Network Monitor  
```bash
# Make connection to suspicious IP (configure in settings)
ping 192.168.100.100
curl http://192.168.100.100:4444
```

## Dashboard Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live event feed
- **System Health**: CPU, memory, process count
- **Security Alerts**: Risk-based notifications  
- **Event History**: Recent security events
- **Threat Statistics**: Detection metrics

## Important Notes

1. **Run as Administrator/Root**: Required for full monitoring capabilities
2. **Educational Purpose**: This is a learning tool, not production-ready
3. **Resource Usage**: Monitors consume CPU/memory - adjust intervals as needed
4. **False Positives**: Fine-tune detection rules to reduce noise

## What It Monitors

### File System
- ‚úÖ Executable files in temp directories
- ‚úÖ Rapid file changes (ransomware detection)
- ‚úÖ Large file creation
- ‚úÖ System file modifications

### Processes  
- ‚úÖ Suspicious process names (nc, powershell, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Malicious command line patterns
- ‚úÖ Unexpected parent-child relationships

### Network
- ‚úÖ Connections to malicious IPs
- ‚úÖ Suspicious port usage
- ‚úÖ External network connections
- ‚úÖ Port scanning detection

## Alert Levels

- ** Critical**: Immediate threat (malicious IP, ransomware)
- ** High**: Suspicious activity (unknown executables)  
- ** Medium**: Unusual behavior (external connections)
- ** Low**: Normal activity (logged for reference)

## Customization

### Add Custom Rules
Edit `config/rules.json`:
```json
{
  "file_rules": [
    {
      "id": "custom_rule",
      "name": "My Custom Detection", 
      "severity": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Whitelist Processes
Edit `config/settings.py`:
```python
'whitelist_processes': ['chrome.exe', 'firefox.exe', 'your-app.exe']
```

### Email Alerts
Configure SMTP in `config/settings.py`:
```python
'email_alerts': True,
'smtp': {
    'server': 'smtp.gmail.com',
    'username': 'your-email@gmail.com', 
    'password': 'your-app-password'
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### EDR Won't Start
```bash
# Check Python version (3.8+ required)
python --version

# Install missing packages
pip install psutil watchdog flask

# Check permissions
sudo python main.py  # Linux/Mac
```

### Dashboard Not Loading
```bash
# Check if Flask is running
netstat -an | grep 5000

# Start dashboard manually
cd dashboard && python app.py
```

### No Alerts Showing
- Check if you're running as admin/root
- Verify monitoring paths exist
- Test with sample malware files
- Check logs in `logs/edr.log`

## Performance Tips

- Reduce monitoring frequency for better performance
- Exclude large directories from file monitoring  
- Use specific paths instead of recursive monitoring
- Adjust detection thresholds to reduce false positives

## Contributing

Ways to enhance the EDR:
- Add YARA rule integration
- Implement machine learning detection
- Create mobile alerts
- Add more threat intelligence feeds
- Improve dashboard with charts/graphs

# How Mini EDR Protects Your Laptop Endpoint

## Real-World Protection Scenarios

### 1. **Malware Download Protection**

**Scenario**: You accidentally download malware from a phishing email

**How Mini EDR Helps**:
```
Email arrives with "Invoice.exe" attachment
You download it to Downloads folder
File Monitor detects: executable file in user directory
Risk Assessment: HIGH (suspicious file type + location)
Automatic Response: 
   - Quarantine the file immediately
   - Send alert to dashboard
   - Log incident for investigation
   - Email notification (if configured)

Result: Malware blocked before execution
```

### 2. **Ransomware Attack Prevention**

**Scenario**: Ransomware starts encrypting your files

**How Mini EDR Helps**:
```
Ransomware executes and begins file encryption
File Monitor detects rapid file changes:
   - document1.txt ‚Üí document1.txt.encrypted
   - photo1.jpg ‚Üí photo1.jpg.locked
   - video1.mp4 ‚Üí video1.mp4.crypto
   
Pattern Recognition: 10+ files changed in 30 seconds
CRITICAL ALERT: "Possible ransomware activity detected"
Automatic Response:
   - Terminate suspicious processes
   - Quarantine encrypted files
   - Block network connections
   - Immediate dashboard alert

Result: Ransomware stopped after encrypting few files
```

### 3. **Command & Control (C2) Communication Block**

**Scenario**: Malware tries to connect to attacker's server

**How Mini EDR Helps**:
```
Hidden malware attempts to "phone home"
Network Monitor detects connection to suspicious IP
Destination: 192.168.100.100:4444 (configured as malicious)
CRITICAL ALERT: "Connection to known malicious IP"
Automatic Response:
   - Block the connection
   - Identify source process
   - Terminate malicious process
   - Add IP to permanent block list

Result: C2 communication blocked, malware isolated
```

### 4. **PowerShell Attack Detection**

**Scenario**: Attacker uses PowerShell for "living off the land" attack

**How Mini EDR Helps**:
```
PowerShell launches with suspicious command:
   "powershell -enc <base64_encoded_payload>"
   
Process Monitor analyzes:
   - Suspicious process name: powershell.exe
   - Malicious pattern: "-enc" (encoded command)
   - Parent process: outlook.exe (email attachment)
   
HIGH ALERT: "Suspicious PowerShell activity"
Automatic Response:
   - Terminate PowerShell process
   - Block similar command patterns
   - Flag parent process for investigation

Result: Attack stopped before payload execution
```

### 5. **USB/External Drive Malware**

**Scenario**: Infected USB drive auto-runs malware

**How Mini EDR Helps**:
```
USB drive inserted with autorun.exe
File Monitor detects:
   - New executable in removable drive
   - Automatic execution attempt
   
Analysis shows:
   - File location: E:\autorun.exe
   - No digital signature
   - Suspicious file patterns
   
MEDIUM ALERT: "Executable on removable media"
Response Options:
   - Quarantine file
   - Block execution
   - Scan entire USB drive

Result:  USB malware contained before spreading
```
